        ’He’s dreaming now,’ said Tweedledee: ‘and what do you think he’s
        dreaming about?’
      </p>

      <p>
        Alice said ‘Nobody can guess that.’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Why, about you!’ Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly.
        ‘And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you’d be?’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Where I am now, of course,’ said Alice.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Not you!’ Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. ‘You’d be nowhere.
        Why, you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘If that there King was to wake,’ added Tweedledum,
        ‘you’d go out—bang!—just like a candle!’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘I shouldn’t!’ Alice exclaimed indignantly. ‘Besides, if I’m only
        a sort of thing in his dream, what are you, I should like to know?’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Ditto’ said Tweedledum.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Ditto, ditto’ cried Tweedledee.
      </p>

      <p>
        He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn’t help saying,
        ‘Hush! You’ll be waking him, I’m afraid, if you make so much noise.’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Well, it no use your talking about waking him,’ said Tweedledum,
        ‘when you’re only one of the things in his dream. You know very well
        you’re not real.’
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘I am real!’ said Alice and began to cry.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘You won’t make yourself a bit realler by crying,’ Tweedledee remarked:
        ‘there’s nothing to cry about.’
